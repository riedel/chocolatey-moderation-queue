Requires Powershell 5.1+ (Core 7+ recommended).

This package installs the FogApi module in the AllUsers/System scope for:

  - Powershell 7+ (C:\Program Files\Powershell\Modules\FogApi{version})
  - Powershell 5.1 (C:\Program Files\WindowsPowershell\Modules\FogApi{version})

This ensures compatibility across pwsh versions (which are both included in Win11),
removing any other existing versions to avoid conflicts.
The uninstall script removes the specific version installed via Chocolatey.
You can customize this behavior with package parameters, though defaults are recommended.

## Package Parameters

You can set the following parameters to alter the install behavior:

  - /PS7Only: (true/false) - Install/uninstall only for Powershell 7. Defaults to false. Overwrites PS5Only if BOTH are true
  - /PS5Only: (true/false) - Install/uninstall only for Powershell 5. Defaults to false.
  - /NoRemove: (true/false) - Do not remove other versions. Defaults to false.
  - /RemoveAll: (true/false) - Uninstall all versions. Defaults to false.

Examples:

Install for Pwsh 7 only without removing other versions: ``choco install fogapi --params ""'/PS7Only:true /NoRemove:true'""``
Uninstall all versions: ``choco uninstall fogapi --params ""'/RemoveAll'""``
      
# FOG Api Powershell Module

This is a powershell module to simplify the use of the Fog Project API.
This module is used to easily run Fog API commands on your fogserver from a powershell console or script.
FOG is an opensource tool for imaging comptuters, this module uses the API on your internal fog server to 
perform almost any operation you can do in the GUI of Fog and provides you with the ability to extend things further.
It can be used to create more automation or to simply have a command line method of controlling fog operations.
This essentially gives you a crossplatform commandline interface for fog tasks and makes many things easier to automate.

Docs for this module can be found at https://fogapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# Versioning

The versioning of this module follows this pattern

`{Year|Month}.{Major Version}.{Revision #}`

See https://github.com/darksidemilk/FogApi?tab=readme-ov-file#versioning for more info

# Usage

You can use Set-fogserverSettings to set your fogserver hostname and api keys.
The first time you try to run a command the settings.json file will automatically open
in notepad on windows, nano on linux, or TextEdit on Mac
You can also open the settings.json file and edit it manually before running your first command.
The default settings are explanations of where to find the proper settings since json cannot have comments

Once the settings are set you can have a jolly good time utilzing the fog documentation
found here https://news.fogproject.org/simplified-api-documentation/ that was used to model the parameters

The Open Component Model command line client supports the work with OCM
artifacts, like Component Archives, Common Transport Archive,
Component Repositories, and Component Versions.

Additionally it provides some limited support for the docker daemon, OCI artifacts and
registries.

It can be used in two ways:
- *verb/operation first*: here the sub commands follow the pattern *<verb> <object kind> <arguments>*
- *area/kind first*: here the area and/or object kind is given first followed by the operation according to the pattern
  *[<area>] <object kind> <verb/operation> <arguments>*

The command accepts some top level options, they can only be given before the sub commands.

A configuration according to [ocm configfile](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_configfile.md) is read from a ¬¥.ocmconfig¬¥ file
located in the ¬¥HOME¬¥ directory. With the option ¬¥--config¬¥ other
file locations can be specified. If nothing is specified and no file is found at the default
location a default configuration is composed according to known type specific
configuration files.

The following configuration sources are used:
  - The docker configuration file at ¬¥~/.docker/config.json¬¥ is
    read to feed in the configured credentials for OCI registries.

  - The npm configuration file at ¬¥~/.npmrc¬¥ is
    read to feed in the configured credentials for NPM registries.



With the option ¬¥--cred¬¥ it is possible to specify arbitrary credentials
for various environments on the command line. Nevertheless it is always preferable
to use the cli config file.
Every credential setting is related to a dedicated consumer and provides a set of
credential attributes. All this can be specified by a sequence of ¬¥--cred¬¥
options.

# GitButler

Git branch management tool, built from the ground up for modern workflows

![gitbutler_client](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/assets/16262535/0d180bfd-7a3c-4a66-a923-30534c5a8197)

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it's a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB's Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git's user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

This repository hosts source code, design documents, and binary releases of the command line version of Duplicacy.  There is also a Duplicacy GUI frontend built for Windows and Mac OS X available from https://duplicacy.com.

There is a special edition of Duplicacy developed for VMware vSphere (ESXi) named [Vertical Backup](https://www.verticalbackup.com) that can back up virtual machine files on ESXi to local drives, network or cloud storages.

## Features

There are 3 core advantages of Duplicacy over any other open-source or commercial backup tools:

* Duplicacy is the *only* cloud backup tool that allows multiple computers to back up to the same cloud storage, taking advantage of cross-computer deduplication whenever possible, without direct communication among them.  This feature literally turns any cloud storage server supporting only a basic set of file operations into a sophisticated deduplication-aware server.  

* Unlike other chunk-based backup tools where chunks are grouped into pack files and a chunk database is used to track which chunks are stored inside each pack file, Duplicacy takes a database-less approach where every chunk is saved independently using its hash as the file name to facilitate quick lookups.  The lack of a centralized chunk database not only makes the implementation less error-prone, but also produces a highly maintainable piece of software with plenty of room for development of new features and usability enhancements.

* Duplicacy is fast.  While the performance wasn't the top-priority design goal, Duplicacy has been shown to outperform other backup tools by a considerable margin, as indicated by the following results obtained from a [benchmarking experiment](https://github.com/gilbertchen/benchmarking) backing up the [Linux code base](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) using Duplicacy and 3 other open-source backup tools.

When generating documentation for class derived from a base class or for interface implementation (e.g. .NET Framework or your custom framework), GhostDoc will use the documentation that Microsoft or the framework vendor has already written for the base class or interface.

## Benefits

- Save keystrokes and time; simplify documenting your code
- Automatically generate a starting point for your help documentation
- Benefit of the base class documentation
- StyleCop compliant documentation templates
- (Pro) Documentation quality and maintenance
- (Pro) Code Spell Checker
- (Pro) Build Help File
- (Pro) Take control of your help files with Help Configurations and Template Libraries
- See [this page](http://submain.com/ghostdoc/editions/) for the full comparison between editions.

If you follow good naming conventions in your code, then you will get very decent results on the summary GhostDoc generates. When I see code that is not documented, it is as simple as hit Ctrl-Shift-D to have GhostDoc document it.

When generating documentation for class derived from a base class or for interface implementation (e.g. .NET Framework or your custom framework), GhostDoc will use the documentation that Microsoft or the framework vendor has already written for the base class or interface.

## Benefits

- Save keystrokes and time; simplify documenting your code
- Automatically generate a starting point for your help documentation
- Benefit of the base class documentation
- StyleCop compliant documentation templates
- (Pro) Documentation quality and maintenance
- (Pro) Code Spell Checker
- (Pro) Build Help File
- (Pro) Take control of your help files with Help Configurations and Template Libraries
- See [this page](http://submain.com/ghostdoc/editions/) for the full comparison between editions.

If you follow good naming conventions in your code, then you will get very decent results on the summary GhostDoc generates. When I see code that is not documented, it is as simple as hit Ctrl-Shift-D to have GhostDoc document it.

The Open Component Model command line client supports the work with OCM
artifacts, like Component Archives, Common Transport Archive,
Component Repositories, and Component Versions.

Additionally it provides some limited support for the docker daemon, OCI artifacts and
registries.

It can be used in two ways:
- *verb/operation first*: here the sub commands follow the pattern *<verb> <object kind> <arguments>*
- *area/kind first*: here the area and/or object kind is given first followed by the operation according to the pattern
  *[<area>] <object kind> <verb/operation> <arguments>*

The command accepts some top level options, they can only be given before the sub commands.

A configuration according to [ocm configfile](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_configfile.md) is read from a ¬¥.ocmconfig¬¥ file
located in the ¬¥HOME¬¥ directory. With the option ¬¥--config¬¥ other
file locations can be specified. If nothing is specified and no file is found at the default
location a default configuration is composed according to known type specific
configuration files.

The following configuration sources are used:
  - The docker configuration file at ¬¥~/.docker/config.json¬¥ is
    read to feed in the configured credentials for OCI registries.

  - The npm configuration file at ¬¥~/.npmrc¬¥ is
    read to feed in the configured credentials for NPM registries.



With the option ¬¥--cred¬¥ it is possible to specify arbitrary credentials
for various environments on the command line. Nevertheless it is always preferable
to use the cli config file.
Every credential setting is related to a dedicated consumer and provides a set of
credential attributes. All this can be specified by a sequence of ¬¥--cred¬¥
options.

# GitButler

Git branch management tool, built from the ground up for modern workflows

![gitbutler_client](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/assets/16262535/0d180bfd-7a3c-4a66-a923-30534c5a8197)

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it's a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB's Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git's user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Litecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. 
Litecoin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. 
Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. Litecoin features faster 
transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency. With substantial 
industry support, trade volume and liquidity, Litecoin is a proven medium of commerce complementary to Bitcoin.

### Disk requirements - Litecoin blockchain (public transactional database) size

# GitButler

Git branch management tool, built from the ground up for modern workflows

![gitbutler_client](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/assets/16262535/0d180bfd-7a3c-4a66-a923-30534c5a8197)

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it's a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB's Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git's user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed

- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

- Fixes a bug where in rare cases, the app failed to detect that a hunk depends on a change in the current lane - moving that hunk to another lane was putting the app in a bad state.
- Fixes a bug where sometimes upon applying a remote branch, the applied one has a -1 suffix, causing the app to not detect the remote branch and not show PR information
- Fixes a bug where it was possible accidentally to push again a branch that was already integrated (eg. already merged on GitHub)
- Adds context menus (right click) to PR buttons with additional actions
- Fixes a bug where sometimes the modal prompting for credentials is not shown
- Fixes a bug where the ""copy PR link"" context menu did not work
- Fixes a UI glitch where dashed lines are rendered incorrectly 
- Fixes a bug where sometime clicking inside a modal closes it
- Fixes an issue where the ""Refetch PR status"" context menu action did not work
- Fixes a bug where in some cases the branch header was showing incorrect remote name
- When dragging commits between lanes, the branch headers will be rendered as drop zones, instead of the uncommitted area
- Fixes a Windows specific bug where the ""Open in VSCode"" button on files and hunks did not work
- Fixes a reactivity bug where after a fetch, if a branch is detected as integrated at the upstream, the UI was not rendering the commits as integrated until the page was reloaded.

Elvish is:

-   A powerful scripting language.

-   A shell with useful interactive features built-in.

-   A statically linked binary for Linux, BSDs, macOS or Windows.

Elvish is pre-1.0. This means that breaking changes will still happen from time
to time, but it's stable enough for both scripting and interactive use.

## How it works

This tool simply mirrors the content of a screen region into a hidden window. In your meeting app you then can just share the content of this hidden window.

**Region to Share is not aware of your meeting app nor what the meeting app is doing with the content of the window.**
It's up to your meeting app whether it properly shares this hidden windows content or not - if it's not working as expected, there is nothing Region to Share can do about this.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11
- DotNet 4.6.2 or newer

## Installation

- Download and install this app from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N4066W2R5Q4)
  or pick the latest binariers from the [release page](https://github.com/tom-englert/RegionToShare/releases)

## Usage

- Start the ""RegionToShare"" app.
- Move the window to the region you want to share.
- In your meeting app start sharing the window ""Region to Share"".

![StartSharing](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tom-englert/RegionToShare@main/src/Assets/StartSharing.gif)

- Now click the ""Region to Share"" window to start sharing the selected region.
  The window will change to the region selection frame, and others are seeing what's inside this frame.
- Close the region frame to stop showing the region without stopping to share.

It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

Vim is often called a programmer's editor, and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.

## Features

* **Vim**: Vim terminal(CLI) application can be used from Powershell and Command Prompt.

* **GVim**: The GUI version of Vim provides full featured Windows GUI application experience.

* **Terminal Integration**: Batch files are created to provide `vim`, `gvim`, `evim`, `view`, `gview`, `vimdiff`, `gvimdiff` and `vimtutor` command on terminal use.

* **Shell Integration**: Vim is added in `Open with ...` context menu. And by default `Edit with Vim` context menu is created to open files whose extensions are associated with other applications.

## Package parameters

- `/InstallDir` - Override the installation directory. By default, the software is installed in `$ChocolateyToolsLocation`, it's default value is `C:\tools`. You can include spaces. See the example below.

## Using security baselines in your organization 

Microsoft is dedicated to providing its customers with secure operating systems, such as Windows 10 and Windows Server, and secure apps, such as Microsoft Edge. In addition to the security assurance of its products, Microsoft also enables you to have fine control over your environments by providing various configuration capabilities. 

Even though Windows and Windows Server are designed to be secure out-of-the-box, many organizations still want more granular control over their security configurations. To navigate the large number of controls, organizations need guidance on configuring various security features. Microsoft provides this guidance in the form of security baselines.

We recommend that you implement an industry-standard configuration that is broadly known and well-tested, such as Microsoft security baselines, as opposed to creating a baseline yourself. This helps increase flexibility and reduce costs. 

Here is a good blog about [Sticking with Well-Known and Proven Solutions](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/fdcc/2010/10/06/sticking-with-well-known-and-proven-solutions/).

## What are security baselines? 

Every organization faces security threats. However, the types of security threats that are of most concern to one organization can be completely different from another organization. For example, an e-commerce company may focus on protecting its Internet-facing web apps, while a hospital may focus on protecting confidential patient information. The one thing that all organizations have in common is a need to keep their apps and devices secure. These devices must be compliant with the security standards (or security baselines) defined by the organization. 

A security baseline is a group of Microsoft-recommended configuration settings that explains their security impact. These settings are based on feedback from Microsoft security engineering teams, product groups, partners, and customers. 

## Why are security baselines needed? 

Security baselines are an essential benefit to customers because they bring together expert knowledge from Microsoft, partners, and customers. 

For example, there are over 3,000 Group Policy settings for Windows 10, which does not include over 1,800 Internet Explorer 11 settings. Of these 4,800 settings, only some are security-related. Although Microsoft provides extensive guidance on different security features, exploring each one can take a long time. You would have to determine the security impact of each setting on your own. Then, you would still need to determine  the appropriate value for each setting. 

In modern organizations, the security threat landscape is constantly evolving, and IT pros and policy-makers must keep up with security threats and make required changes to Windows security settings to help mitigate these threats. To enable faster deployments and make managing Windows easier, Microsoft provides customers with security baselines that are available in consumable formats, such as Group Policy Objects backups.",Windows Security Baseline 1809,,2024-11-04T05:18:59.227,,3,https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/WinSecurityBaseline/20.1803.0,https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/WinSecurityBaseline/20.1803.0,https://rawcdn.githack.com/devnomadic/Chocolatey-WinSecurityBaseline/6c9feb19bd88c5016b10b82947c97bfc4ab8f1de/MS_SecurityIntelligence_Icon.png,false,false,false,,1900-01-01T00:00:00,https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/public/LICENSE,true,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10,https://github.com/devnomadic/Chocolatey-WinSecurityBaseline/pull/7,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319,https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines,,,false,false,Unknown,,

Measure Killer can help you clean and optimize your tenant and datasets. This can drastically reduce dataset refresh times and thus lower the memory and CPU usage of your Premium capacity. You can run our tool on all models in your tenant to remove unused columns and measures.
This mode shows you on a tenant level in which reports custom visuals are used or what is going on in personal workspaces. It can analyze the whole tenant in a short time and provide unique insights regarding report-level measures, calculated columns or best practices violations. There is also a new access tab showing workspace, artifact and user-level access.

**Deleting unused measures**
Measure Killer can identify and remove unused measures. The tool can write to the model directly to remove them. Don't worry if you made a mistake, the restore feature can help you out.

**Deleting unused columns**
Measure Killer will generate an M-Code to delete unused columns. This code can be pasted into Power Query's Advanced Editor to remove these columns from the model. Calculated columns can be removed directly by writing to the model (locally or in the Power BI Service)

**Analyzing reports**
For every report analyzed, Measure Killer will generate a comprehensive Excel file to show where an artifact is used.

# GitButler

Git branch management tool, built from the ground up for modern workflows

![gitbutler_client](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/assets/16262535/0d180bfd-7a3c-4a66-a923-30534c5a8197)

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it's a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB's Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git's user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Main Features

- **Virtual Branches**
  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches
  - Automatically create new branches when needed
- **Easy Commit Management**
  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping
- **Undo Timeline**
  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation
- **GitHub Integration**
  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more
- **Easy SSH Key Management**
  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically
- **AI Tooling**
  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress
  - Automatically create descriptive branch names
- **Commit Signing**
  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH

- Updated lane header, displaying the branch name (as opposed to lane name which is no longer relevant)
- Improved app performance with large repositories
- Adds the ability to add branch descriptions (via the ... context menu) which the app will also use if a PR is created
- Double click on branch to rename is now possible after pushing (still with a confirmation window)
- Generated commit messages are now streamed if configured to be proxied via GitButler
- Fixes a bug where sometimes when a new branch is created, the auto-generated name would collide with an existing branch, showing a confusing state until renamed
- Fixes a bug where in some conditions, incorrect remote commits are displayed (appearing as duplicates)
- Fixes a performance bug with files drag and dropping (e.g. amending a commit or moving lanes)
- Fixes a bug where in rare cases the app would incorrectly redirect to the onboarding (requiring an app restart)
- Fixes a bug where uncommitted changes are moved to the default lane
- Fixes a bug with the layout of the PR description text area
- Fixes a bug with truncating file paths when displayed in narrow lane
- Fixes a bug where the app prevents using `.` in branch names
- Fixes a incorrectly wrapped error message when testing commit signing in settings

HTTP Toolkit is a suite of open-source tools for debugging, testing, and building with HTTP(S) traffic. It offers a powerful, simple interface to capture, view, and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. HTTP Toolkit is composed of several repositories, read the README for more information.

## Features
- **HTTP Debugging**: Debug any HTTP(S) traffic from any app, instantly.
- **Automatic Setup**: Auto-configure your device or use manual setup.
- **Interception**: Intercept & rewrite HTTP traffic on the fly.
- **Real-time View**: See the whole conversation in real-time.
- **HTTPS Support**: Full support for intercepting HTTPS traffic.
- **Mock & Edit**: Mock endpoints, rewrite requests, and responses.
- **Powerful Filters**: Filter traffic by URL, headers, body, and more.

The [httptoolkit GitHub organization](https://github.com/httptoolkit) contains the entire project, including the account management servers and paid features. All components are open source, licensed under a mixture of copyleft AGPL and permissive Apache-2/MIT licenses.

All repos:
* [HTTP Toolkit Website](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-website) - the source for [the website](https://httptoolkit.com), including the marketing pages, the blog, and the docs.
* [HTTP Toolkit UI](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-ui) - the core of the product, a TypeScript + React app that powers most of the functionality you use, except for things that can't be done in a web page (i.e. starting a proxy, and setting up client interception).
* [HTTP Toolkit Server](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server) - the backend of the product, a TypeScript + node.js server that does the things the UI can't do: starting a proxy, and setting up client interception.
* [Mockttp](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp) - the HTTP(S) proxy itself, and all low-level logic around that, as a standalone TypeScript library. Used in HTTP Toolkit for traffic interception, but also usable standalone as a testing tool, or as a programmatically controllable intercepting HTTP(S) proxy.
* [HTTP Toolkit for Android](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-android) - the Android app, a native Kotlin + Java app that manages certificate trust & enforces HTTP interception on Android devices.
* [HTTP Toolkit Desktop](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-desktop) - a TypeScript + Electron wrapper, which combines the UI & the server and builds convenient per-platform installers.

Each repo has a README explaining setup and functionality.

# Kindle Comic Converter
Kindle Comic Converter (KCC) is a Python app to convert comic/manga files to EPUB, Panel View MOBI or E-Ink optimized CBZ. It was initially developed for Kindle but since version 4.6 outputs valid EPUB 3.0 so despite its name, KCC is actually a comic/manga to EPUB converter that every e-reader owner can happily use. It can also optionally optimize images by applying a number of transformations.

## Warning
KCC is not Amazon's Kindle Comic Creator (AKKC) nor is it in any way endorsed by Amazon. Amazon's tool is for comic publishers and involves a lot of manual effort, while KCC is for comic/manga readers. AKKC in no way is a replacement for KCC so you can be quite confident that the development will carry on.

## Input formats
KCC can understand and convert from, at the moment, the following input types:
* Folders containing: PNG, JPG, GIF or WebP files
* CB7, 7Z
* CBR, RAR
* CBZ, ZIP
* PDF (only extracting JPG images)

## Output formats
* CBZ
* EPUB
* MOBI/AZW3 (see [MOBI support](#mobi-support))

## MOBI support
Support for MOBI files is provided by [kindlegen](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/kindlegen) dependency.

## Installation Parameters
* `/AddToStartMenu:` - adds Kindle Comic Converter shortcut to Start menu (for all users or for the current user only)
    - Supported values: `allusers`, `curruser`, `no`
    - Default value: `allusers`

### Examples
* Install and add a shortcut to Start Menu for all users
    ```
    choco install kindle-comic-converter
    ```
* Install and add a shortcut to Start Menu for the current user only
    ```
    choco install kindle-comic-converter --params ""/AddToStartMenu:curruser""
    ```
* Install and do not add any shortcut to Start Menu
    ```
    choco install kindle-comic-converter --params ""/AddToStartMenu:no""

It works with a technology which reads audio CDs almost perfectly. If there are any errors that can‚Äôt be corrected, it will tell you on which time position the (possible) distortion occurred, so you could easily control it with e.g. the media player.

## Features

- All kinds of CD and DVD drives are supported (including USB, Firewire, SATA and SCSI drives)
- Hidden sector synchronization (jitter correction)
- A secure, a fast and a burst extraction methods selectable. Fast extraction should run at the same speed as other grabbers with jitter correction, but is probably not exact anymore. Burst mode just grabs the audio data without any synchronization.
- Detection of read errors and complete losses of sync and correction in the secure mode, as far as possible
- Output of time positions of all non-exact corrections and the possibility to listen to these positions
- EAC is able to copy ranges of music data, not only tracks
- Automatic speed reduction on read errors and fallback to a higher speed afterwards (depends on the used drive)
- Volume normalization of extracted audio to a given percentage
- Usage of the Windows Audio Compression manager (ACM Codecs) for direct compression to e.g. MP3 waves
- Support for the LAME DLL that is usable like an ACM Codec for on-the-fly MP3 compression
- Support of external MP3, WMA, flac and OggVorbis encoders for automatic compression after extraction (supports multi-processor environments)
- Batch compression to WAV files and decompression of supported encoded files to WAV
- Compression offset support for exact compression/decompression
- Detection of pre-track gaps (positions where negative track times runs towards 00:00:00)
- Detection of silence in pre-track gaps
- Automatic creation of CUE sheets for Burnnn, Feurio, Nero or even EAC, which can include all gaps, indicies, track attributes, UPC and ISRC and also CD-Text for an exact copy
- CD player functionality and prelistening to selected ranges
- Automatic detection of drive features, whether a drive has an accurate stream and/or does caching
- Sample offsets for drives with noaccurate streams, including the option of filling up missing samples with silence
- Synchronizing between tracks for non-accurate stream drives
- Trackname editing with local/remote CD databases support and more features like ID3 tagging
- Browse and edit local database
- Certified Escient ¬Æ CDDB(TM)Compatible
- Local CDDB support
- Record and loop record functions for recording from LP, radio, etc.
- Automatic renaming of MP3 files accordingto their ID3 tag
- Catalog extraction function (e.g. first 20 seconds of a track)
- Multisession (CD-Extra) support
- CD-Text support
- CD-Write support for some drives (internally and using CDRDAO)
- ID3 V1.1 tag editor with drag and drop ability from track listing and CD database browser
- Glitch removal after extraction
- Small WAV editor with the following functionality: delete, trim, normalize, pad, glitch removal, pop detection, interpolation of ranges, noise reduction, fade in/out, undo (and much more)

### Helper functions

The following helpers are currently included:

- Invoke-ChocoShortcutInstallation
- Invoke-ChocoShortcutUninstallation
- Invoke-EmptyDirectoryRemoval
- Remove-EmptyDirectories (meant to be used by Invoke-EmptyDirectoryRemoval, but can be used alone)

See the docs (the readme) for full documentation.

#### Invoke-ChocoShortcutInstallation

This helper Installs a shortcut with Install-ChocolateyShortcut and logs the shortcut path to a file (by default in the package directory). Every subsequent shortcut created (within the same chocolateyInstall script) will be appended to the same log file. That log file can then be used by Invoke-ChocoShortcutUninstallation to uninstall all shortcuts for that package.

It allows for all the same parameters as Install-ChocolateyShortcut. It has a few additional tricks, though.

You can add desktop shortcuts like this:

```powershell
Install-ChocolateyShortcut -Desktop ""Notepad++.lnk"" ""C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe""
```

If you want to place the shortcut in a (new or existing) folder on the desktop, you can add it to the first parameter:

```powershell
Install-ChocolateyShortcut -Desktop ""Text Editors\Notepad++.lnk"" ""C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe""
```

And you can add start menu shortcuts like this:

```powershell
Install-ChocolateyShortcut -StartMenu ""Notepad++.lnk"" ""C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe""
```

When using the `StartMenu` parameter, you can also use the `Users` parameter, specifying whether it should install a shortcut for all users, for the current user only, or to automatically decide. By default, it will automatically decide.

```powershell
Install-ChocolateyShortcut -StartMenu ""Notepad++.lnk"" ""C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe"" -Users Current
```

#### Invoke-ChocoShortcutUninstallation

This helper removes shortcut listed in a log created by Invoke-ChocoShortcutUninstallation.

#### Invoke-EmptyDirectoryRemoval

This helper deletes empty directories recursively in the specified directory, and then deletes the directory itself if it is empty.

If the directory is not empty, the following warning will be shown:

```text
- Data remains in the [name] directory.
Manually delete the [name] directory if you do not wish to keep the data.
[Name] directory: '[Path];'""

# GitButler

Git branch management tool, built from the ground up for modern workflows

![gitbutler_client](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/assets/16262535/0d180bfd-7a3c-4a66-a923-30534c5a8197)

GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time.
It allows you to quickly organize file changes into separate branches while still having them applied to your working directory.
You can then push branches individually to your remote, or directly create pull requests.

In a nutshell, it's a more flexible version of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i`, allowing you to efficiently multitask across branches.

## How Does It Work?

GitButler keeps track of uncommitted changes in a layer on top of Git. Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.

## How Do GB's Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?

The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.

GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.

And finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

## Why GitButler?

We love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git's user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.

Instead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.

## Tech

GitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

MozillaCacheView is a small utility that reads the cache folder of Firefox/Mozilla/Netscape Web browsers, and displays the list of all files currently stored in the cache.

For each cache file, the following information is displayed: URL, Content type, File size, Last modified time, Last fetched time, Expiration time, Fetch count, Server name, and more.

You can easily select one or more items from the cache list, and then extract the files to another folder, or copy the URLs list to the clipboard.

SshRunAs allows one to run a command on a remote or local machine as a different user via an SSH connection.  This is a front-end to the [SSH.Net](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET) Library.

The advantage of SshRunAs is unlike OpenSSH, you can pass in a raw password to this program.

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SshRunAs-Win-x64.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SshRunAs-Win-x64/)
[![Chocolatey](https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/v/sshrunas.svg)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/sshrunas/)

## Use Cases

The main use case for this is to run a single command on a server via SSH.  OpenSSH can do this, but you are not allowed to pass in a password through the command line.  This bypasses that requirement, you can indirectly pass a username and password into SshRunAs.  

Honestly, if you need to use this, you should reconsider all other options, such as using SSH Keys.  This is really a last resort when things such as weird corporate IT policies get in the way.

## When not to use

This should not be used when:

* You can use SSH Keys (Just use OpenSSH in that case).
* Someone can view your process's environment variables (Passwords are stored in plaintext there).  Typically a user needs root or admin to do this anyways.
* You are on Linux.  Linux has a better tool called [SshPass](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass), use that instead.",sshrunas ssh runas password sshpass windows admin,Copyright ¬© Seth Hendrick 2019-2024,2024-11-10T17:48:35.04,,1,https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sshrunas/4.0.1,https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/sshrunas/4.0.1,https://rawcdn.githack.com/xforever1313/SshRunAs/b92587025b0ce210a7de335d931960073496de36/Assets/icon.png,false,false,false,,1900-01-01T00:00:00,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xforever1313/SshRunAs/master/LICENSE_1_0.txt,false,https://github.com/xforever1313/SshRunAs,,https://github.com/xforever1313/SshRunAs,,,https://github.com/xforever1313/SshRunAs/issues,false,false,Unknown,,

### VST plugins support
ocenaudio supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, giving its users access to numerous effects. Like the native effects, VST effects can use real-time preview to aide configuration.

### Real-time preview of effects
Applying effects such as EQ, gain and filtering is an important part of audio editing. However, it is very tricky to get the desired result by adjusting the controls configuration alone: you must listen the processed audio. To ease the configuration of audio effects, ocenaudio has a real time preview feature: you hear the processed signal while adjusting the controls.

The effect configuration window also includes a miniature view of the selected audio signal. You can navigate on this miniature view in the same way as you do on the main interface, selecting parts that interest you and listening to the effect result in real time.

### Cross-platform support
ocenaudio is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Native applications are generated for each platform from a common source, in order to achieve excelent performance and seamless integration with the operating system. All versions of ocenaudio have a uniform set of features and the same graphical interface, so the skills you learn in one platform can be used in the others.

To assist ocenaudio development, a powerful toolset of audio editing, analysis and manipulation called Ocen Framework was created. ocenaudio is also based on Qt framework, a well known library for cross-platform development.

### Multi-selection for delicate editions
To speed up complex audio files editing, ocenaudio includes multi-selection. With this amazing tool, you can simultaneously select different portions of an audio file and listen, edit or even apply an effect to them.

For example, if you want to normalize only the excerpts of an interview where the interviewee is talking, just select them and apply the effect.

### Efficient editing of large files
With ocenaudio, there is no limit to the length or the quantity of the audio files you can edit. Using an advanced memory management system, the application keeps your files open without wasting any of your computer's memory. Even in files several hours long, common editing operations such as copy, cut or paste happen almost instantly.

Try it, you will be amazed!

### Fully featured spectrogram
Besides offering an incredible waveform view of your audio files, ocenaudio has a powerful and complete spectrogram view. In this view, you can analyze the spectral content of your audio signal with maximum clarity.

Advanced users will be surprised to find that the spectrogram settings are applied in real time. The display is updated immediately when altering features such as the number of frequency bands, window type and size and dynamic range of the display.

### VST plugins support
ocenaudio supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, giving its users access to numerous effects. Like the native effects, VST effects can use real-time preview to aide configuration.

### Real-time preview of effects
Applying effects such as EQ, gain and filtering is an important part of audio editing. However, it is very tricky to get the desired result by adjusting the controls configuration alone: you must listen the processed audio. To ease the configuration of audio effects, ocenaudio has a real time preview feature: you hear the processed signal while adjusting the controls.

The effect configuration window also includes a miniature view of the selected audio signal. You can navigate on this miniature view in the same way as you do on the main interface, selecting parts that interest you and listening to the effect result in real time.

### Cross-platform support
ocenaudio is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Native applications are generated for each platform from a common source, in order to achieve excelent performance and seamless integration with the operating system. All versions of ocenaudio have a uniform set of features and the same graphical interface, so the skills you learn in one platform can be used in the others.

To assist ocenaudio development, a powerful toolset of audio editing, analysis and manipulation called Ocen Framework was created. ocenaudio is also based on Qt framework, a well known library for cross-platform development.

### Multi-selection for delicate editions
To speed up complex audio files editing, ocenaudio includes multi-selection. With this amazing tool, you can simultaneously select different portions of an audio file and listen, edit or even apply an effect to them.

For example, if you want to normalize only the excerpts of an interview where the interviewee is talking, just select them and apply the effect.

### Efficient editing of large files
With ocenaudio, there is no limit to the length or the quantity of the audio files you can edit. Using an advanced memory management system, the application keeps your files open without wasting any of your computer's memory. Even in files several hours long, common editing operations such as copy, cut or paste happen almost instantly.

Try it, you will be amazed!

### Fully featured spectrogram
Besides offering an incredible waveform view of your audio files, ocenaudio has a powerful and complete spectrogram view. In this view, you can analyze the spectral content of your audio signal with maximum clarity.

Advanced users will be surprised to find that the spectrogram settings are applied in real time. The display is updated immediately when altering features such as the number of frequency bands, window type and size and dynamic range of the display.

Over 200 million active users in four years.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange.

POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.

100% FREE and NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

### VST plugins support
ocenaudio supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, giving its users access to numerous effects. Like the native effects, VST effects can use real-time preview to aide configuration.

### Real-time preview of effects
Applying effects such as EQ, gain and filtering is an important part of audio editing. However, it is very tricky to get the desired result by adjusting the controls configuration alone: you must listen the processed audio. To ease the configuration of audio effects, ocenaudio has a real time preview feature: you hear the processed signal while adjusting the controls.

The effect configuration window also includes a miniature view of the selected audio signal. You can navigate on this miniature view in the same way as you do on the main interface, selecting parts that interest you and listening to the effect result in real time.

### Cross-platform support
ocenaudio is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Native applications are generated for each platform from a common source, in order to achieve excelent performance and seamless integration with the operating system. All versions of ocenaudio have a uniform set of features and the same graphical interface, so the skills you learn in one platform can be used in the others.

To assist ocenaudio development, a powerful toolset of audio editing, analysis and manipulation called Ocen Framework was created. ocenaudio is also based on Qt framework, a well known library for cross-platform development.

### Multi-selection for delicate editions
To speed up complex audio files editing, ocenaudio includes multi-selection. With this amazing tool, you can simultaneously select different portions of an audio file and listen, edit or even apply an effect to them.

For example, if you want to normalize only the excerpts of an interview where the interviewee is talking, just select them and apply the effect.

### Efficient editing of large files
With ocenaudio, there is no limit to the length or the quantity of the audio files you can edit. Using an advanced memory management system, the application keeps your files open without wasting any of your computer's memory. Even in files several hours long, common editing operations such as copy, cut or paste happen almost instantly.

Try it, you will be amazed!

### Fully featured spectrogram
Besides offering an incredible waveform view of your audio files, ocenaudio has a powerful and complete spectrogram view. In this view, you can analyze the spectral content of your audio signal with maximum clarity.

Advanced users will be surprised to find that the spectrogram settings are applied in real time. The display is updated immediately when altering features such as the number of frequency bands, window type and size and dynamic range of the display.

Over 200 million active users in four years.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange.

POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.

100% FREE and NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

## Create your way
Do you scribble great ideas on napkins and sticky notes? Is precise filing more your style? OneNote's got you covered whatever way you shape your thoughts. Type, write or draw with the free form feel of pen to paper. Search and clip from the web to picture ideas.

## Collaborate with anyone
Your team is conquering the idea of the century. Your family is planning the menu for a big reunion. Stay on the same page and in sync wherever you are.

## Think with ink

chezmoi helps you manage your personal configuration files (dotfiles, like `~/.gitconfig`) across multiple machines.

chezmoi is helpful if you have spent time customizing the tools you use (e.g. shells, editors, and version control systems) and want to keep machines running different accounts (e.g. home and work) and/or different operating systems (e.g. Linux, macOS, and Windows) in sync, while still being able to easily cope with differences from machine to machine.

chezmoi scales from the trivial (e.g. copying a few dotfiles onto a Raspberry Pi, development container, or virtual machine) to complex long-lived multi-machine development environments (e.g. keeping any number of home and work, Linux, macOS, and Windows machines in sync). In all cases you only need to maintain a single source of truth (a single branch in git) and getting started only requires adding a single binary to your machine (which you can do with `curl`, `wget`, or `scp`).

chezmoi has strong support for security, allowing you to manage secrets (e.g. passwords, access tokens, and private keys) securely and seamlessly using a password manager and/or encrypt whole files with your favorite encryption tool.",configuration dotfile dotfiles,Copyright (c) 2018-2024 Tom Payne,2024-10-10T08:28:21.647,,5,https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chezmoi/2.52.4,https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/chezmoi/2.52.4,https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/raw/master/assets/images/logo-144px.png,false,false,false,,1900-01-01T00:00:00,https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/blob/master/LICENSE,false,https://chezmoi.io/,"## Changelog

### Prerequisite
* JDK (Java Development Kit) is required. It can be any JDK compatible with Oracle JDK 8. It was not listed as dependency, in order to support different variations of JDK.
* Environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to be set to a JDK path. Many JDK installers already do this for users.

### Usage
After installation, configuration and application data are installed in a folder named `Tomcat9` (or the correct major version), which locates in `%ProgramData%` (or `%LocalAppData%` when admin right is not granted). The folder is supposed to be managed by user (site manager), and it will not be touched when this package gets upgraded or uninstalled.

If admin right is granted, a [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service) is installed with service name `Tomcat9` and display name beginning with ‚ÄúApache Tomcat‚Äù. It is neither started nor enabled (start on boot) by default.

These are easy to remember (for humans) but difficult to guess (for humans and computers).

## Why use it?

Because you can make passphrases which are as strong as traditional ""strong"" passwords (8 letters long, upper, lower, numbers, etc) which you can memorise in 5 minutes instead of 5 days. (And its fun to read the phrases it generates!)

Use this passphrase to protect:

* Your KeePass, 1Password, LastPass or favourite password manager database.
* You computer login at home or work.
* Your eBay, Facebook, Google, OpenID or other high value account.
* Your Internet banking account.

Some examples passphrases:

* a wound rebuffs an incline
* the statesman will burgle amidst lucid sunlamps
* plaid foresails repel ashamedly upon the birdbath
* 234 readers affably build the untouched athlete
* Sydney reasoned ""an edible sleeve fumbles the argumentative float""

We're told the best password is at least 8 characters 12 characters long, contains upper and lower case letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Unfortunately, this makes the ""best"" password something which looks like gibberish and is, frankly, quite hard for ordinary people to remember.

Perhaps something like: 3h4o.%\vJACj

I used to generate 12-16 character passwords like this and memorise them. It would commonly take up to two weeks of typing them in multiple times per day. All told, I've memorised perhaps 10 of these in my life. They get used for my KeePass database, Windows logons (at work and home) and Truecrypt volume, but nothing else because I can't afford to memorise any more (lest I memorise a password and my address falls out of my brain!).

That is all too hard!

So we resort to taking a some word from the dictionary, capitalise a few letters, turn an o into a 0 and stick some punctuation at the end: like our friend Tr0ubador. Only problem is, while that is easy to remember (well, easier according to XKCD), its also trivially easy for a computer to guess.

I memorised the statesman will burgle amidst lucid sunlamps after typing it twice. And, even if some evil hacker knows my dictionary (which it will, because its included with this project), that passphrase is still equivalent to an 11 letter password with upper, lower, numbers and symbols (using the 13k word dictionary from version 0.13).

Much, much easier, I think. (So does my wife!)

Over 200 million active users in four years.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange.

POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.

100% FREE and NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

Over 200 million active users in four years.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange.

POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.

100% FREE and NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

## Create your way
Do you scribble great ideas on napkins and sticky notes? Is precise filing more your style? OneNote's got you covered whatever way you shape your thoughts. Type, write or draw with the free form feel of pen to paper. Search and clip from the web to picture ideas.

## Collaborate with anyone
Your team is conquering the idea of the century. Your family is planning the menu for a big reunion. Stay on the same page and in sync wherever you are.

## Think with ink
Ready. Set. Draw. A stylus or fingertip is the only tool you need. Take handwritten notes and convert them to typed text later. Highlight what's important and express ideas with colors or shapes.

## Access from anywhere
Take note. It's easy to pull up your content from anywhere, even if you're offline. Start on your laptop then update notes on your phone. OneNote works on any device or platform.

### VST plugins support
ocenaudio supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, giving its users access to numerous effects. Like the native effects, VST effects can use real-time preview to aide configuration.

### Real-time preview of effects
Applying effects such as EQ, gain and filtering is an important part of audio editing. However, it is very tricky to get the desired result by adjusting the controls configuration alone: you must listen the processed audio. To ease the configuration of audio effects, ocenaudio has a real time preview feature: you hear the processed signal while adjusting the controls.

The effect configuration window also includes a miniature view of the selected audio signal. You can navigate on this miniature view in the same way as you do on the main interface, selecting parts that interest you and listening to the effect result in real time.

### Cross-platform support
ocenaudio is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Native applications are generated for each platform from a common source, in order to achieve excelent performance and seamless integration with the operating system. All versions of ocenaudio have a uniform set of features and the same graphical interface, so the skills you learn in one platform can be used in the others.

To assist ocenaudio development, a powerful toolset of audio editing, analysis and manipulation called Ocen Framework was created. ocenaudio is also based on Qt framework, a well known library for cross-platform development.

### Multi-selection for delicate editions
To speed up complex audio files editing, ocenaudio includes multi-selection. With this amazing tool, you can simultaneously select different portions of an audio file and listen, edit or even apply an effect to them.

For example, if you want to normalize only the excerpts of an interview where the interviewee is talking, just select them and apply the effect.

### Efficient editing of large files
With ocenaudio, there is no limit to the length or the quantity of the audio files you can edit. Using an advanced memory management system, the application keeps your files open without wasting any of your computer's memory. Even in files several hours long, common editing operations such as copy, cut or paste happen almost instantly.

Try it, you will be amazed!

### Fully featured spectrogram
Besides offering an incredible waveform view of your audio files, ocenaudio has a powerful and complete spectrogram view. In this view, you can analyze the spectral content of your audio signal with maximum clarity.

Advanced users will be surprised to find that the spectrogram settings are applied in real time. The display is updated immediately when altering features such as the number of frequency bands, window type and size and dynamic range of the display.

## Features

FFSJ is...

* **Very fast:** FFSJ can optimize disk-cache and memory usage, this makes FFSJ 3-5 times faster than HJ-Split, WinSplit, MasterSplitter in both splitting and joining tasks. Of course, it is much faster than any compression program.
* **Simple:** FFSJ works well on all Windows platforms. FFSJ-Lite doesn't need any requirement of installations or complicated DLLs. FFSJ-Standard has only one simple installation package for integrating FFSJ into shell context menu.
* **Small:** Both FFSJ-Lite and FFSJ-Standard editions are small enough to fit on a floppy disk.
* **Easy to use:** FFSJ has a friendly user-interface, it can be used to split any file. FFSJ-standard can also create its shell context menus in order to perform splitting and joining tasks directly from Windows Explorer.
* **Easy to be integrated:** Since v3.0, FFSJ published its command-line interface. End-users can split/join multiple files using a .BAT file. Developers can write their own interface (in any language) to perform splitting/joining tasks from their applications.
* **Secure:** FFSJ uses an advanced encryption algorithm to make your data much more secure from unauthorized access. Since v2.9, MD5 checksum algorithm has also been integrated to verify data integrity.
* **Compatible:** FFSJ can join parts produced by HJ-Split.
* **Free and Safe:** FFSJ-Lite and FFSJ-Standard are free and clean, both editions do not contain any form of adwares, spywares, viruses, trojans and backdoors.",ffsj split join file,,2024-11-02T14:36:26.943,autohotkey.portable::,15,https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ffsj/3.3.0,https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/ffsj/3.3.0,,false,false,false,,1900-01-01T00:00:00,http://www.fastfilejoiner.com/,false,http://www.fastfilejoiner.com/,,,,,,false,false,Unknown,,

### VST plugins support
ocenaudio supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, giving its users access to numerous effects. Like the native effects, VST effects can use real-time preview to aide configuration.

### Real-time preview of effects
Applying effects such as EQ, gain and filtering is an important part of audio editing. However, it is very tricky to get the desired result by adjusting the controls configuration alone: you must listen the processed audio. To ease the configuration of audio effects, ocenaudio has a real time preview feature: you hear the processed signal while adjusting the controls.

The effect configuration window also includes a miniature view of the selected audio signal. You can navigate on this miniature view in the same way as you do on the main interface, selecting parts that interest you and listening to the effect result in real time.

### Cross-platform support
ocenaudio is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Native applications are generated for each platform from a common source, in order to achieve excelent performance and seamless integration with the operating system. All versions of ocenaudio have a uniform set of features and the same graphical interface, so the skills you learn in one platform can be used in the others.

To assist ocenaudio development, a powerful toolset of audio editing, analysis and manipulation called Ocen Framework was created. ocenaudio is also based on Qt framework, a well known library for cross-platform development.

### Multi-selection for delicate editions
To speed up complex audio files editing, ocenaudio includes multi-selection. With this amazing tool, you can simultaneously select different portions of an audio file and listen, edit or even apply an effect to them.

For example, if you want to normalize only the excerpts of an interview where the interviewee is talking, just select them and apply the effect.

### Efficient editing of large files
With ocenaudio, there is no limit to the length or the quantity of the audio files you can edit. Using an advanced memory management system, the application keeps your files open without wasting any of your computer's memory. Even in files several hours long, common editing operations such as copy, cut or paste happen almost instantly.

Try it, you will be amazed!

### Fully featured spectrogram
Besides offering an incredible waveform view of your audio files, ocenaudio has a powerful and complete spectrogram view. In this view, you can analyze the spectral content of your audio signal with maximum clarity.

Advanced users will be surprised to find that the spectrogram settings are applied in real time. The display is updated immediately when altering features such as the number of frequency bands, window type and size and dynamic range of the display.

Backgammon is a board game for two players in which each has 15 stones which move between 24 triangular points according to the roll of a pair of dice. The object of the game is to move all of one's pieces around, and bear them off the board.

GNU Backgammon has a graphical user interface, but can also be played on command-line. On text-only terminals, it will display an ASCII rendering of the board. Both money games and tournaments can be analyzed.
    
### Features

The following features can be found in the current release of GNU Backgammon.

* A command line interface (with full command editing features if GNU readline is available) that lets you play matches and sessions against GNU Backgammon with a rough ASCII representation of the board on text terminals.
* Support for a GTK+ interface with a graphical board window. Both 2D and 3D graphics are available.
* Tournament match and money session cube handling and cubeful play. All governed by underlying cubeless money game based neural networks.
* Support for both 1-sided and 2-sided bearoff databases: 1-sided bearoff database for 15 checkers on the first 6 points and optional 2-sided database kept in memory. Optional larger 1-sided and 2-sided databases stored on disk.
* Automated rollouts of positions, with lookahead and variance reduction where appropriate. Rollouts may be extended.
* Automatic and manual annotation (analysis and commentary) of games and matches.
* Record keeping of statistics of players in games and matches (both native inside GNU Backgammon and externally using relational databases and Python).
* Loading and saving analyzed games and matches as .sgf files (Smart Game Format).
* Exporting positions, games and matches to: (.eps) Encapsulated Postscript, (.gam) Jellyfish Game, (.html) HTML, (.mat) Jellyfish Match, (.pdf) PDF, (.png) Portable Network Graphics, (.pos) Jellyfish Position, (.ps) PostScript, (.sgf) GNU Backgammon File, (.tex) LaTeX, (.txt) Plain Text, (.txt) Snowie Text
* Import of matches and positions from a number of file formats: (.bgf) BGRoom Game, (.gam) GammonEmpire Game, (.gam) PartyGammon Game, (.mat) Jellyfish Match, (.pos) Jellyfish Position, (.sgf) GNU Backgammon File, (.sgg) GridGammon Save Game, (.tmg) TrueMoneyGames, (.txt) Snowie Text
* Python Scripting ability.
* Native language support; 15 languages complete or in progress: (cs_CZ, da_DK, en_GB; en_US, fi_FI, fr_FR, de_DE, el_GR, is_IS, it_IT, ja_JP, ro_RO, ru_RU, es_ES and tr_TR)

Interested? Read the [release announcement](https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge).

## Feature Highlights
### INTEGRATED MERGE TOOL
The Integrated Merge Tool allows you to resolve any merge conflicts directly in Sublime Merge, rather than having to open up your editor of choice.

Conflicts are presented with a 3-pane view. On the left are your changes and on the right are theirs. In the center pane is the resolved text, with buttons to choose between your changes or theirs. The same text editing functionality as Sublime Text is also available for more complicated merges.

Clicking on the header in the middle pane will switch between the editable merge results and the base file.

Use Ctrl+S or the Save button to save your merged file.

### POWERFUL SEARCH
Use find-as-you-type search to dig up the exact commit you're looking for.

Search for commit messages, commit authors, file names, and wildcard patterns. Complex search queries can be constructed using and, or and () symbols.

For example min-parents:2 author:jskinner path:tests/* (bug fix or test) will search for a merge commit from jskinner inside the tests directory that contain the words bug and fix or the word test.

You can open search with Ctrl+F or through the menu: Navigate ‚ñ∂ Search.

### UNMATCHED PERFORMANCE
Sublime Merge is built on the same custom platform as Sublime Text, providing unmatched responsiveness. With a powerful, cross-platform UI toolkit, an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, and a custom high-performance Git reading library, Sublime Merge sets the bar for performance.

### BLAME
Open the Blame of a file through the Command Palette or when viewing a commit to see exactly which lines of the file were added by which commits.

Easily view the age, author, and commit hash of every line of code and see which lines come from the same commit with our commit color coding. Click a line in the gutter to highlight all other lines from the same commit.

The blame tool will also detect when a piece of code was moved from another place in your repository, so you can truly follow the history of your code.

### ADVANCED DIFFS
Where it makes sense we will show you exactly which individual characters have been changed for a commit.

This includes when you rename or move a file, when you're resolving conflicts or just viewing commit history.

Select any two commits in Sublime Merge with Ctrl+Left Mouse to show the diff between them.

### FILE AND HUNK HISTORY
From any file or hunk in the history use ‚Ä¶ ‚ñ∂ File History or the Hunk History button to view the full history of that source code. This will also follow any file moves or renames throughout the repository.

### COMMAND PALETTE AND KEY BINDINGS
Keyboard usage is important to us. Use Tab to navigate through parts of the application, Space to toggle expansion, and Enter to stage/unstage hunks. When writing a commit message, use Ctrl+Enter to commit.

The Command Palette is triggered by Ctrl+P and allows quick access to a large set of Git commands as well as other Sublime Merge functionality.

### LIGHT AND DARK THEMES
Choose between a light and a dark theme to suit your tastes. You can preview these themes above.

Open the Preferences ‚ñ∂ Preferences‚Ä¶ menu to change theme.

The dark theme is only available with a valid license key.

### EXTENSIBILITY
Just like Sublime Text, just about everything in Sublime Merge is extensible. Key bindings, menus, theming, and the command palette are all customizable with simple JSON files.

## Package parameters

- `/InstallDir` - Installation directory. If the Gitlab Runner is already installed, its current directory will be used. To install to a new directory, uninstall it first.
- `/Service` - Install as a service. If value is not specified system account will be used. If value is specified it is in the form of `Username:Password`. The installer will create that user if it doesn't exist, add it to local administrators group, enable _ServiceLogonRight_ and disable password expiration. Example: `/Service:gitlab-runner:P@ssw0rd`. Can't be used with `Autologon` parameter
- `/Autologon` - Use autologon feature of Windows. Can't be used with `Service` parameter. Username and password must be provided. Example: `/Autologon:gitlab-runner:P@ssw0rd`.

## Notes

- The script `register_example.ps1` is provided along the executable which can be used to quickly register runner non-interactively. If you want to use it, rename it to `register.ps1` and set desired environment variables.
- Autologon vs Service: Services do not have access to all Windows features and some scripts, particularly those that depend on GUI, are not usable.",admin cli foss git cross-platform build docker shell gitlab,GitLab,2024-10-29T03:13:05.187,chocolatey-core.extension:1.3.5.1:|git.install:2.34.1:,0,https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gitlab-runner/17.5.2,https://community.chocolatey.org/package/ReportAbuse/gitlab-runner/17.5.2,https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/majkinetor/chocolatey/gitlab-runner/icon.png,false,false,false,,1900-01-01T00:00:00,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/blob/2a956c92d14ea7cbd8a4e50cee401b1b9cfacbb1/LICENSE,false,https://docs.gitlab.com/runner,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/tree/main,https://docs.gitlab.com/runner,,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues,false,false,Unknown,,

## Create your way
Do you scribble great ideas on napkins and sticky notes? Is precise filing more your style? OneNote's got you covered whatever way you shape your thoughts. Type, write or draw with the free form feel of pen to paper. Search and clip from the web to picture ideas.

## Collaborate with anyone
Your team is conquering the idea of the century. Your family is planning the menu for a big reunion. Stay on the same page and in sync wherever you are.

## Think with ink
Ready. Set. Draw. A stylus or fingertip is the only tool you need. Take handwritten notes and convert them to typed text later. Highlight what's important and express ideas with colors or shapes.

## Access from anywhere
Take note. It's easy to pull up your content from anywhere, even if you're offline. Start on your laptop then update notes on your phone. OneNote works on any device or platform.

## Features

* Lighting on supported Corsair products
* Fan and cooler speed, temperature modding etc.
* Mouse and keyboard settings and macros
* Power supply monitoring and fan control
* Much more!

iCUE‚Äôs single intuitive interface links together supported CORSAIR products, allowing you to quickly and easily fine-tune your settings. Supported CORSAIR keyboards and mice are fully programmable with macros or key remaps, letting you specify a button or click to do anything from instant shortcuts to complex strings of commands. iCUE's robust level of customization helps you create, write, and play faster and more efficiently.

The depth to which device settings can be changed results in a tailored experience unique to each user. Adjust mouse sensitivity to your exacting preferences, down to single DPI steps, or tinker with your headset‚Äôs equalizer settings to create your ideal listening experience. iCUE also saves your settings as profiles which you can swap between instantly ‚Äì or even launch automatically with your favorite programs.

Finally, take advantage of iCUE to unleash the boundless customization of RGB-lighting equipped CORSAIR peripherals. Choose from dozens of preset lighting patterns and effects to illuminate your workspace or design your own multi-layer lighting profiles. Best of all, lighting can be synchronized across all iCUE-compatible devices for truly intricate light shows.

Whether you play on Windows or Mac, install iCUE to enable intelligent control and unlimited possibilities for your CORSAIR peripherals.

Over 200 million active users in four years.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie‚ÄìHellman secure key exchange.

POWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.

100% FREE and NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content ‚Äî messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don‚Äôt wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram ‚Äî join the revolution today.

This browser, even though fairly close to Gecko-based browsers like Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey in the way it works, is based on a different layout engine and offers a different set of features.

It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

The project includes these modules:

* Hadoop Common: The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules.
* Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS‚Ñ¢): A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
* Hadoop YARN: A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.
* Hadoop MapReduce: A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.

## Notes
The package sets the HADOOP\_HOME environment variable and adds HADOOP\_HOME\bin to the machine path.

The package by default will unzip to **C:\Hadoop**. This location can be changed, see below.

## Package Parameters
The following package parameters can be set:

* `/unzipLocation` - Unzip to a different path than default.

These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
For example: `choco install hadoop -params '""/unzipLocation:D:\Hadoop""'`.

## Notes

- You might need to use `--ignore-checksums` option when installing this package due to the fact that vendor overwrites historic download locations. Automatic updater will release new version with choco fix notation when that happens, but the push of this package can fail due to the longstanding bug with chocolatey gallery.

### VST plugins support
ocenaudio supports VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, giving its users access to numerous effects. Like the native effects, VST effects can use real-time preview to aide configuration.

### Real-time preview of effects
Applying effects such as EQ, gain and filtering is an important part of audio editing. However, it is very tricky to get the desired result by adjusting the controls configuration alone: you must listen the processed audio. To ease the configuration of audio effects, ocenaudio has a real time preview feature: you hear the processed signal while adjusting the controls.

The effect configuration window also includes a miniature view of the selected audio signal. You can navigate on this miniature view in the same way as you do on the main interface, selecting parts that interest you and listening to the effect result in real time.

### Cross-platform support
ocenaudio is available for all major operating systems: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Native applications are generated for each platform from a common source, in order to achieve excelent performance and seamless integration with the operating system. All versions of ocenaudio have a uniform set of features and the same graphical interface, so the skills you learn in one platform can be used in the others.

To assist ocenaudio development, a powerful toolset of audio editing, analysis and manipulation called Ocen Framework was created. ocenaudio is also based on Qt framework, a well known library for cross-platform development.

### Multi-selection for delicate editions
To speed up complex audio files editing, ocenaudio includes multi-selection. With this amazing tool, you can simultaneously select different portions of an audio file and listen, edit or even apply an effect to them.

For example, if you want to normalize only the excerpts of an interview where the interviewee is talking, just select them and apply the effect.

### Efficient editing of large files
With ocenaudio, there is no limit to the length or the quantity of the audio files you can edit. Using an advanced memory management system, the application keeps your files open without wasting any of your computer's memory. Even in files several hours long, common editing operations such as copy, cut or paste happen almost instantly.

Try it, you will be amazed!

### Fully featured spectrogram
Besides offering an incredible waveform view of your audio files, ocenaudio has a powerful and complete spectrogram view. In this view, you can analyze the spectral content of your audio signal with maximum clarity.

Advanced users will be surprised to find that the spectrogram settings are applied in real time. The display is updated immediately when altering features such as the number of frequency bands, window type and size and dynamic range of the display.

## Notes

* The [Vim mailing list Url](http://www.vim.org/maillist.php) causes Package Validation to regularly fail, so it was removed from the metadata.
* This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s), to let the know the package is no longer updating, using:
    * The 'Contact Maintainers' link on the package page, or
    * The 'Package Source' link on the package page and raising an issue.

### Antivirus Detections

* The x86 edition was removed from the package due to consistently high AV detections stopping the package from being approved.
* The embedded binaries are regularly flagged by antivirus engines.
